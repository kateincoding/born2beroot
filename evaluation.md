* Basic functioning of the virtual machine

A virtual machine, commonly shortened to just VM, Aâ€¯Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps (is no different than any other physical computer). It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed. While the parts that make up your computer (called hardware) are physical and tangible, VMs are often thought of as virtual computers or software-defined computers within physical servers, existing only as code.
